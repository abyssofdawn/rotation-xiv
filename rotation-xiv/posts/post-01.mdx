## Welcome to tranceofthought.net!

This website serves as a home for tools I create and my thought processes about my interests. 
For this website, I take a less personal approach to blogging, which means the posts are normally not be about me. 
They are my ideas and work as relevant to this website and the tools I maintain.
Be warned, posts here can be heavy in technical language.

This website is built on the Next.js framework. The color scheme for the styling is Everforest.
Math is written in KaTeX. Posts are written in MDX and parsed by contentlayer.

## Motivation

For some time, I have looked for certain tools for niche situations, normally in relation to FFXIV.
After months of fiddling around with native tools I built myself, I found myself bogged down in UI implementation.
Many of the tools I created were limited by my lack of time to build robust UI systems.
I eventually decided it would be very worth it to create a certain tool in a webapp.
The reasons are twofold:

1. sdas
2. sadsad
