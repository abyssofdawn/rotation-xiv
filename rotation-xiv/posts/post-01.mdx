## Welcome to tranceofthought.net!

This website serves as a home for tools I create and my thought processes about my interests. 
For this website, I take a less personal approach to blogging, so the posts are normally not be about me. 
They are my ideas and work as relevant to this website and the tools I maintain.

This website is built on the Next.js framework. The color scheme for the styling is Everforest.
Math is written in KaTeX. Posts are written in MDX and parsed by contentlayer.

## Motivation

For some time, I have looked for certain tools for niche situations, normally in relation to FFXIV.
After months of fiddling around with native tools I built myself, I found myself bogged down in UI implementation.
Many of the tools I created were limited by my lack of time to build robust UI systems.
I eventually decided it would be very worth it to create a certain tool in a webapp.
The reasons are twofold:

- The UI elements are inherent to each component, and styling doesn't take forever
- I want anyone to be able to access the tools.

What this ultimately means is anyone should be able to use my apps without downloading anything, and without a gross UI.

## Tools

I haven't mentioned the tools I'd like to make yet. 
So far, I have only worked on one.

My first tool is a *combat rotation maker* for Final Fantasy XIV.
Every rotation maker I could find was crude and just a drag and drop list of icons.
This is unoptimal for my use-case, and doesn't even have bounds checking to see whether a rotation is valid or not.
My tool shows a timeline of the fight, and allows you to input stats.
Skills can be prohibited while they are still on cooldown, combos are tracked, and animation lock and ping are taken into account.
There are many more ideas planned.

## Thanks

Thank you for taking time to visit and browse my website, it means a lot.
